For my next project I wanted to do something really unhinged for my chaotic friend Chad. We joke about beans alot so I wondered if I could make a baked bean ice cream. Chad is really into old western films so I themed it around that. I decided to see if I could smoke the milk and it worked! Then candied bacon and added it with baked beans to the churn. Very divisive. Some folks were reviled by the bean texture other weren't too fond of the smoke flavor. I actually thought the smoke flavor worked well but the main issue here was I had added bourbon which raised the freezing point making the base texture not as good as normal. Should've been softer. Still got alot of laughs out of this one.
