                                    <p>Ellis was my old roommate for a couple years! After recently hanging out she gave me a bunch of tea she had imported recently. I used my techniques from Water Lilies here and was able to successfully infuse the flavor in and make a great texture. So much so that me and other friends killed two pints pretty quickly. Will be more deliberate in these texture techniques going forward!</p>

                                    <p>For my next project I wanted to do something really unhinged for my chaotic friend Chad. We joke about beans alot so I wondered if I could make a baked bean ice cream. Chad is really into old western films so I themed it around that. I decided to see if I could smoke the milk and it worked! Then candied bacon and added it with baked beans to the churn. Very divisive. Some folks were reviled by the bean texture other weren't too fond of the smoke flavor. I actually thought the smoke flavor worked well but the main issue here was I had added bourbon which raised the freezing point making the base texture not as good as normal. Should've been softer. Still got alot of laughs out of this one.</p>

                                    <p>This was the first project in my ice cream series. I wanted to do it for my dear friend Illya as he is always pushing me to challenge myself with projects. Illya and I used to work at the Art Institute together so I wanted to theme it around that. Since he had given me some Parisian tea, I decided to theme it after Monet's Water Lilies. I torched cinnamon bark and let it sit in the milk with some of the tea to infuse it. Then made lemon cake that I added during the churn. The lemon cake was like the yellow lilies arising from the water and the base had a nice cereal milk flavor quality.</p>
