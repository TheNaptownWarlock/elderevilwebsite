# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Current Status
✅ Code pushed to GitHub  
✅ Requirements.txt updated  
✅ Supabase integration working locally  

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Access Streamlit Cloud
- Go to: https://share.streamlit.io/
- Sign in with your GitHub account
- Find your app: `bencon-2026` or similar

### 2. Configure Secrets
In your Streamlit Cloud app settings, add these secrets:

```
SUPABASE_URL = https://uvsdbuonyfzajhtrgnxq.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InV2c2RidW9ueWZ6YWpodHJnbnhxIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjEwNjUxNjgsImV4cCI6MjA3NjY0MTE2OH0.tq_dQfCIl68bSt2BUPP0lWW2DjjwPpxcKV6LIt2LRFg
```

### 3. Redeploy
- Since we just pushed to GitHub, Streamlit Cloud should automatically redeploy
- If not, manually trigger a redeploy from the dashboard

### 4. Test the Deployment
- Visit: https://bencon-2026.streamlit.app/
- Test the following features:
  - User registration/login
  - Quest creation
  - Private messaging
  - Tavern chat
  - RSVP functionality

## Features Working
✅ Private messaging with Supabase  
✅ Event creation with overlap detection  
✅ Real-time chat in Tavern  
✅ User profiles and avatars  
✅ Quest Counter with RSVPs  
✅ Medieval theme styling  

## Troubleshooting
If deployment fails:
1. Check the logs in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Verify secrets are correctly configured
3. Ensure all dependencies are in requirements.txt
4. Check Supabase table permissions

## Next Steps
After successful deployment:
1. Test all functionality
2. Share the URL with users
3. Monitor usage and performance
4. Consider adding more features based on user feedback
