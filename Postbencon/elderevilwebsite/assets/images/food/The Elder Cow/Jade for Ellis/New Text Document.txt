Ellis was my old roommate for a couple years! After recently hanging out she gave me a bunch of tea she had imported recently. I used my techniques from Water Lilies here and was able to successfully infuse the flavor in and make a great texture. So much so that me and other friends killed two pints pretty quickly. Will be more deliberate in these texture techniques going forward!
