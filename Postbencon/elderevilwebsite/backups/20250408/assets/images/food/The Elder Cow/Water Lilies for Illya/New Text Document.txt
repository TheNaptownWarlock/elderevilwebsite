This was the first project in my ice cream series. I wanted to do it for my dear friend Illya as he is always pushing me to challenge myself with projects. Illya and I used to work at the Art Institute together so I wanted to theme it around that. Since he had given me some Parisian tea, I decided to theme it after Monet's Water Lilies. I torched cinnamon bark and let it sit in the milk with some of the tea to infuse it. Then made lemon cake that I added during the churn. The lemon cake was like the yellow lilies arising from the water and the base had a nice cereal milk flavor quality.
