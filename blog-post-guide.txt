BLOG POST CREATION GUIDE
=======================

1. OPENING THE TEMPLATE
   - Open blog-template.html in your browser
   - This is your starting point for creating new blog posts

2. FILLING OUT THE FORM
   - Post Title: Enter your blog post title
   - Post Date: Select the publication date
   - Post Content: Write your blog post content (supports multiple paragraphs)
   - Optional: Upload an image for your post

3. USING THE BUTTONS
   - "Preview Post": Click to see how your post will look
   - "Generate Post": Click to create a zip file containing your blog post

4. AFTER GENERATING
   - Extract the downloaded zip file to the blog-posts directory
   - The structure will be:
     blog-posts/
     └── your-post-title/
         ├── index.html
         └── images/
             └── your-image.jpg

5. UPDATING THE MAIN SITE
   - Open index.html
   - Add a new blog post preview section in the blog section
   - Link to your new post using the format:
     <article class="blog-post">
         <h3>Your Post Title</h3>
         <p class="blog-date">Date</p>
         <p>Preview text of your blog post...</p>
         <a href="./blog-posts/your-post-title/" class="read-more">Read More</a>
     </article>

6. GIT WORKFLOW
   After creating your new post:
   git add blog-posts/your-post-title/
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Add new blog post: [Your Post Title]"
   git push

7. BEST PRACTICES
   - Keep image sizes consistent
   - Use descriptive alt text for images
   - Maintain consistent formatting
   - Test links before pushing
   - Preview changes locally before committing

8. FILE STRUCTURE
   Each blog post has its own folder:
   blog-posts/
   └── post-title/
       ├── index.html
       └── images/
           └── post-image.jpg
